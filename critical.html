    <h1>Critical Thinking</h1>
    <p>
        Critical thinking can be seen as having two components:<br>
         1) a set of information and belief generating and processing skills;<br> 
         2) the habit, based on intellectual commitment, of using those skills to guide behavior.<br> It is thus to be contrasted with:<br> 1) the mere acquisition and retention of information alone, because it involves a particular way in which information is sought and treated; 
         <br>2) the mere possession of a set of skills, because it involves the continual use of them; and<br> 3) the mere use of those skills ("as an exercise") without acceptance of their results.
